# House-Price-Prediction
This project uses the XGBoost algorithm to predict house prices based on a dataset of relevant features.

## Introduction
The data is part of an ML competition, *Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users* (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-data-for-ml-course).

> Competition Description
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.
